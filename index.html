        <ul>
          <li>Element: what is inside an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tag: what is inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Brackets are less than and greater than signs in HTML.</li>
          <li>"head" holds information for site and browser, contains meta (description, keywords, author, viewport) and title.</li>
          <li>"body" holds all the information the user can see and interact with, like this information being read now.</li>
          <li>"ul" unordered list, for bullet points like this doc.</li>
          <li>"ol" ordered list, for numbered lists.</li>
          <li>"h1" for main title, the higher "h(x)" the smaller the title text.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>3 different ways to style in CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: for syling a single element directly in the HTML file. Example: adding style="color:red;">Heading that makes the heading red.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet: contains rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. Example: (in brackets) style, tab in, h1 { color :red; }</li>
          <li>External style sheet: most common and easier to change, implants a link in file. Example brac link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" / brac (this goes in head after meta in HTML).</li>
          <li>rel: specifies the relationship between this doc and the linked one.</li>
          <li>href: location of URL or in this case, location in the prework-study-guide/assets/style.css</li> 
          <li>Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or decarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations: Have two components: {Property: Value;} Example: {color: blue;}</li>
          <li>CSS box model: has "Content" in center, "Padding" around that, "Border" around that, and "Margin" around that.</li>
          <li>Margin: the space we want outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding: the the space we want inside of an element.</li>
          <li>To have same declaration to mutiple selector (ex. header and footer) add a comma between.</li>
          <li>Here we have the class "card"'s peramiters in the css file, each of the 4 note sections have been given assigned card for class so all will have these peramiters set in place.</li>
